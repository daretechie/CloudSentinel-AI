## Gap Analysis (Pre-Audit)

### Currently Missing

| Control | Gap | Remediation |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| CC6.4 | Access removal process | Document offboarding procedure |
| CC7.3 | Centralized log analysis | Add Datadog/Sentry integration |
| - | Security awareness training | Document training program |
| - | Formal incident response plan | Expand DR runbook |

### Recommended Pre-Audit Actions

1. **Document access management procedures** - Who can grant/revoke access
2. **Set up log aggregation** - Datadog, Papertrail, or CloudWatch
3. **Create security training record** - Even informal documentation
4. **Expand incident response** - Add communication templates

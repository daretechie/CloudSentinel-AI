"""
Remediation Request Model

Stores pending remediation requests that require human approval.
Implements a full audit trail for compliance and safety.

Workflow:
1. User scans for zombies → sees resources
2. User requests remediation → creates pending request
3. Reviewer approves/rejects → updates status
4. On approval → system executes action (with optional backup)
5. All actions logged for audit
